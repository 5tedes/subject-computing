                category: "hardware",
                question: "What is clock speed?",
                answer: "Clock speed is the speed at which a CPU can execute instructions, measured in Hertz (Hz). For example, a CPU with 3 GHz (gigahertz) can perform 3 billion actions or cycles per second. Higher clock speeds generally mean faster processing."
            },

                question: "What is magnetic storage? How does it work?",
                answer: "Magnetic storage uses magnetized material to store data. Data is written by magnetizing tiny areas of the disk surface in different directions to represent 1s and 0s.\n\nExamples: Hard Disk Drives (HDDs), floppy disks\n\nAdvantages: Large capacity, relatively cheap\nDisadvantages: Mechanical parts can fail, slower than flash"

                question: "What is flash storage? How does it work?",
                answer: "Flash storage uses electronic circuits with no moving parts. It stores data by trapping electrons in memory cells. Data is retained even without power.\n\nExamples: USB drives, SSDs, SD cards, smartphones\n\nAdvantages: Very fast, durable, silent, portable\nDisadvantages: More expensive per GB than magnetic"

                question: "What is PRIMARY storage?",
                answer: "Primary storage is memory that the CPU can access directly and quickly. It is TEMPORARY and loses data when power is off.\n\nExample: RAM (Random Access Memory)\n\nCharacteristics:\n• Very fast access\n• Volatile (data lost without power)\n• Smaller capacity\n• Currently running programs and data"

                question: "What is SECONDARY storage?",
                answer: "Secondary storage is permanent storage for data, programs, and files. It retains data even when the computer is powered off.\n\nExamples: HDD, SSD, USB drives, CDs\n\nCharacteristics:\n• Slower than primary storage\n• Non-volatile (keeps data without power)\n• Much larger capacity\n• Stores operating system, applications, files"
